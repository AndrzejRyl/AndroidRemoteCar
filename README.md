# AndroidRemoteCar

This is a project I've made in collaboration with my friend as a university project. 
Basically the idea is that user can steer a remote car with the help of Android smartphone via bluetooth connection with 
RaspberryPi mounted on that car. User sees live video transmitted from RaspberryPi camera and 
steers the car with two joystick like controlls displayed on the screen.
